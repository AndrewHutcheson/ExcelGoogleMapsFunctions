# ExcelGoogleMapsFunctions
Just a couple functions I wrote. Drop in your API key and feel free to use :) 

I wrote this before I relized excel had built in methods to navigate the dom so I parsed the JSON myself. There are two functions that are pretty self explanatory:

getGoogGps(Address,City,State,Zip) returns a comma delimited lat & long

getGoogDistance(Lat1,Lng1,Lat2,Lng2) returns the distance between two coordinates.
